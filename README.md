Samantha is an intelligent personal assistant inspired by the AI character from the movie "Her". Currently in early development, Samantha aims to provide a natural, intuitive, and helpful AI companion experience.

## üåü Overview

Samantha is designed to be more than just a tool - she's an assistant that learns your preferences, helps organize your digital life, and provides meaningful interactions. This project is in its early stages, with plans to expand functionality significantly in the coming months.

## üîê Authentication

Samantha uses Clerk for authentication, providing:
- Email/password login
- Social login options
- User profile management
- Secure session handling

## üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard

The dashboard is the main interface for interacting with Samantha, featuring:
- Conversation history
- File management
- Search functionality
- User preference settings

## üß∞ Tools and APIs

Samantha is powered by a collection of specialized tools that enable her to perform various tasks. Each tool is designed for a specific purpose and follows a consistent structure for integration.

### Core Tools

| Tool Name | Purpose | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `web_search` | Information retrieval | Searches the web for real-time information on any topic |
| `knowledge_base_query` | Personal data retrieval | Searches through your saved information and history |
| `create_folder` | Organization | Creates a new folder in your personal knowledge base |
| `create_file` | Content storage | Saves content (text, URLs, etc.) to your knowledge base |

### Tool Structure

Each tool in Samantha follows a consistent structure:

```typescript
interface Tool {
  name: string;           // Unique identifier for the tool
  description: string;    // What the tool does
  parameters: {           // Input parameters the tool accepts
    type: "object";
    properties: {
      [key: string]: {
        type: string;     // Data type (string, number, boolean, etc.)
        description: string;
        required?: boolean;
      }
    }
  };
}
```

### Example Tool Implementation

Here's an example of how the `web_search` tool is implemented:

```typescript
const webSearchTool: Tool = {
  name: "web_search",
  description: "Search the web for real-time information about any topic",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      query: {
        type: "string",
        description: "The search term to look up on the web",
        required: true
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### Using Tools in Conversations

Samantha intelligently selects and uses these tools based on user requests. For example:

1. User asks: "What's the weather in New York today?"
2. Samantha identifies this requires real-time information
3. She automatically invokes the `web_search` tool with appropriate parameters
4. The tool fetches current weather data
5. Samantha presents the information in a conversational format



## üß© Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that integrates Samantha into your browsing experience is currently under development and will be added to this repository as a part of a monorepo structure soon. The extension will allow Samantha to:
- Understand context from your browsing
- Provide relevant assistance based on web content
- Save and organize information from the web

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [ ] Improved conversation capabilities and tool calling 
- [ ] Advanced file management
- [ ] Chrome extension integration
